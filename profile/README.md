<h1>DISCLAIMER</h1>
All of our libraries are built on io_uring and/or epoll.
To get the most out of these you should use a Linux kernel version of at least 5.11(This is also the only version we test on).
None of these libraries have guaranteed support so if you have any problems with them and no one responds to your issue you're on your own.
